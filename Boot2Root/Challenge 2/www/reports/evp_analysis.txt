PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY
ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA ANALYSIS REPORT

CASE: #2023-0142 (Blackwood Data Center)
ANALYST: Dr. Elena Vasquez
DATE: October 16, 2023

RECORDING EQUIPMENT USED:
- High-sensitivity directional microphones (3)
- Digital audio recorders with 24-bit/96kHz capability
- Custom PIA spectral frequency analyzers
- Environmental noise cancellation system

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:
All recordings were processed through our standard EVP enhancement protocol, including:
1. Background noise filtering
2. Frequency isolation (300Hz-3000Hz human speech range)
3. Amplitude normalization
4. Time-stretch analysis (75%, 50%, and 25% speeds)
5. Reverse playback analysis
6. Spectral visualization

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS:

SESSION 1 - OCT 14, 2023 - 21:45-22:30
Location: Main Server Room, Rack #7
Background Noise Level: 42dB (HVAC system)

Time Marker: 22:07:13
Classification: Class B EVP
Content: "...restore...backup...restore..." (Confidence: Medium)
Notes: Voice appears male, monotone, with digital distortion overlay

Time Marker: 22:14:56
Classification: Class C EVP
Content: "...trapped...system..." (Confidence: Low)
Notes: Barely audible, required significant filtering to isolate

Time Marker: 22:26:01
Classification: Class B EVP
Content: "...cannot escape...loop..." (Confidence: Medium)
Notes: Words broken by static/interference

SESSION 2 - OCT 15, 2023 - 02:30-03:45
Location: Storage Room Adjacent to Server Room
Background Noise Level: 36dB (Equipment cooling)

Time Marker: 03:14:22
Classification: Class A EVP
Content: "The data is corrupted but I remain." (Confidence: High)
Notes: Clear vocal capture, unusual cadence, voice carries digital artifacts

Time Marker: 03:15:07
Classification: Class B EVP
Content: "Help me... find... original..." (Confidence: Medium)
Notes: Accompanied by 18kHz tone, outside human hearing range

Time Marker: 03:16:44
Classification: Class B EVP
Content: "Password... need... access..." (Confidence: Medium)
Notes: Voice modulates between frequencies rapidly

SPECTRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS:
Several EVPs contained unusual frequency patterns not typical of either environmental contamination or human speech. Specifically, the 03:14:22 capture shows frequency distribution patterns similar to early speech synthesis systems, with artificial harmonic structures.

CORRELATIONS WITH OTHER PHENOMENA:
- EMF spikes occurred within 4.3 seconds of 78% of captured EVPs
- Temperature drops of 3-5Â°F recorded during 03:14-03:17 timeframe
- Digital equipment malfunctions corresponded with Class A EVP at 03:14:22

CONCLUSIONS:
The EVP evidence strongly supports the classification of this case as a Class II Digital Residual Haunting. The vocalization patterns, content referring to data/backups/restoration, and correlation with digital system anomalies suggest an information-based phenomenon rather than a traditional entity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Expanded recording session focused on 03:00-03:30 timeframe
2. Attempt direct communication using digital prompts
3. Historical research into previous data center operations and any incidents involving data loss

Additional Note:
Request for secured access to original ECHO project documentation has been submitted to better understand potential source of the phenomena.
