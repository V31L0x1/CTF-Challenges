DATE: October 5, 2023
TECHNICIAN: J. Martinez
EQUIPMENT CHECKED:
- EMF Detectors (5) - Calibrated and batteries replaced
- Thermal Cameras (3) - Firmware updated to v4.2.1
- Digital Audio Recorders (7) - Tested and verified
- Motion Sensors (12) - Two units (#8, #11) required sensor replacement

TECHNICIAN: A. Williams
EQUIPMENT CHECKED:
- Server Room Equipment Suite - Full system diagnostic
- Data Storage Arrays - Integrity check passed
- Network Monitoring Tools - Updated intrusion detection signatures
- Backup Systems - Verified daily/weekly/monthly rotation is functioning
NOTES: The anomaly detection algorithm needs further refinement. Currently generating too many false positives when analyzing EVP recordings. Will coordinate with Dr. Chen to adjust sensitivity parameters.

TECHNICIAN: A. Williams
EQUIPMENT CHECKED:
- Digital Storage Systems - Defragmentation and integrity check
- Backup Systems - Test restoration performed successfully
- Environmental Sensors - All calibrated
- Power Management Systems - UPS load testing completed
NOTES: Increased backup frequency for critical research data. Daily backups now run at 3AM instead of 5AM due to lower system load. Implemented new data archival process with tar for long-term storage.
