Dear Agent,

Welcome to your first day at the Paranormal Investigation Agency. As you know, 
we've been tracking unusual activity on this server for weeks. We suspect a 
digital entity has gained control of the root account.

Your mission is to gain higher access and confirm the nature of this entity.

Remember your training:
1. Always look for SUID binaries that can be exploited
2. Documentation for "find" command might be particularly helpful
3. The entity leaves traces of its presence in all system operations

Good luck, and be careful. We've lost contact with the last three agents who
attempted this investigation.
